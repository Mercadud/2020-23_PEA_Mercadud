# Analyzing and Visualizing Data
This is a research assignment from Advanced Topics 2 (420-G50) to answer 5 questions that relate to the dataset I chose to analyze and visualize. The 5 questions are:
- What are the price of used cars over the years?
- What are the price of used cars over the years separated by diesel and gas?
- What is the average price for each manufacturer?
- What is the price per kilometers driven?
- How many cars did each manufacturer sell per year?
