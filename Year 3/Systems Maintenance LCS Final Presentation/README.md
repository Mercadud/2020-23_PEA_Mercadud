# LCS Final Presentaion
This presentation was the product of a team effort to maintain the Learning Center System created by a previous team of Heritage College students. It mentions all the improvements done to the system and what's still to be done for it to be sent to production. This was done in the Systems Maintenance (420-K30) course.
#### My Contributions
I primarily worked on the slides mentioning the types of maintenance done and the new features. I also worked on animations of the majority of the pages to keep it consistant.
