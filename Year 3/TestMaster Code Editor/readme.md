# The TestMaster Code Editor
This is a team project from the Development Project 1 (420-K40) and 2 (420-K50) courses. This system is a code testing platform for teachers and students.  My best contribution was the code editor built using the CodeMirror library. It currently only supports java syntax highlighting and plenty of features you'd expect from a modern code editor, such as automatic indentation and shortucts. Here is a little demo isolated from the rest of the system.

### how to run
1. To Install and build the bundle, you must run ``npm start``. To just build the bundle, you can run ``npm run build``.
2. Open the ``index.html`` file using your favorite modern browser.
